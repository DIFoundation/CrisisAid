One-line pitch

A real-time, location-based web platform that helps people quickly find verified emergency resources—shelters, food, medical aid, water, and power—during crises.

1️⃣ Core Problem (What judges must instantly get)

During emergencies (floods, protests, blackouts, disasters), people:

Don’t know where to find help

Can’t verify which resources are available

Waste critical time searching unreliable information

CrisisAid solves this by centralizing verified, location-based emergency resources in one fast, mobile-friendly map.
